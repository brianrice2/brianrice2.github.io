As I look for an internship next summer as part of the MSiA program, referrals can be very valuable. In such a saturated entry-level market, not to mention the strain on businesses caused by COVID-19 and the slow economic recovery, every additional layer that an applicant can provide to demonstrate value and reassure employers matters a lot (of course, referrals are no substitute for skills or experience).

So, I created a simple dashboard to view alumni placements and in one place. You can see it here: [https://rpubs.com/brianrice/msia-jobs](https://rpubs.com/brianrice/msia-jobs)
