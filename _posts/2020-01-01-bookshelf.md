I’ve decided to make a specific post for the books I read each year. This is partly to better remember the books I read, but also to encourage me to read more (for fear of shame from strangers on the internet). Lately, they have been a welcome reprieve from social media and the constant barrage of despairing news stories.

The list will be updated over time as I start and finish new books. So, here is my list for 2020:

- Clean Code by Robert Martin
- Build a Career in Data Science by Emily Robinson and Jacqueline Nolis (a great read!)
- R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund
- R Packages by Hadley Wickham
- Deep Medicine by eric Topol
    - This one took a while to get through! I found myself constantly looking up terminology and companies to get a better picture of what Eric was describing. Regardless, it was really interesting to hear the perspective of medical practitioners and not just AI researchers.
- On Tyranny by Timothy Snyder
- 1984 by George Orwell
- SQL Indexing and Tuning by Markus Winand
- Fluent Python, 2nd ed. by Luciano Ramalho
    - An excellent read — I learned a ton!
- [Unfinished] Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann
- [Unfinished] The Best Short Stories of Dostoevsky, comprised of:
    - White Nights
    - The Honest Thief
    - The Christmas Tree and a Wedding
    - The Peasant Marey
    - Notes from the Underground
    - A Gentle Creature
    - The Dream of a Ridiculous Man
