- [Backing off towards simplicity - why baselines need more love](https://smerity.com/articles/2017/baselines_need_love.html)
    > Take an existing baseline or write it yourself, ensure it remains simple and fast. Then take this simple and fast baseline and push it as far as possible. This means tuning hyperparameters extensively, trying a variety of regularization techniques, sanity checking against bugs and potentially flawed assumptions...As it is fast, you can spend many runs tuning your hyperparameters. As it is simple, bugs and flawed assumptions become easier to find as the model isn't powerful enough to hide it from you.

### Software

For not even working in software, it seems I read an awful lot about software engineering...

### Podcasts

My most frequent listens:

- [Lex Fridman: Artificial Intelligence](https://lexfridman.com/ai/)
    - Lex tends a bit philosophical for my taste, where I am interested more on the engineering side, but still a great podcast. Being one of the more mainstream AI podcasts, there is plenty of content and he brings in some big names for the discussions.
- [NVIDIA: The AI Podcast](https://blogs.nvidia.com/ai-podcast/)
- [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com) (although most of this goes over my head)
- [Jocko Podcast](https://jockopodcast.com/)
- [Linear Digressions](http://lineardigressions.com/)
    - Katie, a co-host of the show, recently gave a talk called [Community-Building for Data Scientists](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/msia-seminar-series-community-building-for-data-scientists-by-katie-malone-registration-103277243014) as part of the MSiA Seminar Series. It was very interesting!
