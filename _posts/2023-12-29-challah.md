Based on the [NYT recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/7199-my-favorite-challah), but with some important missing information included.

## Ingredients

For the dough:

- 11g active dry yeast
- 13g sugar
- 415g lukewarm water (105-115ºF)

- 100g sugar
- 120g vegetable oil
- 17g salt
- 1000g all-purpose flour
- 4 eggs

For baking:

- 1 egg
- Poppy or sesame seeds for sprinkling

## Preparation

1. Proof the yeast

    Mix the yeast, water, and small dose of sugar until dissolved. Wait 5-10 minutes until a light foam surfaces to ensure the yeast is still alive. In the meantime, ready the other ingredients.

    Whisk the oil into the yeast solution. One at a time, beat in the 4 eggs as well as the sugar and salt. Gradually mix in the flour until the dough holds together and whisking becomes annoying. Cover and let rest (autolyse) for 20 minutes.

2. Bulk fermentation

    Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth.

    Transfer the dough to a large, lightly oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover and let rest for ~1 hour until doubled in size.

    Punch down the dough, cover, and let rise again for another 30 minutes. Start preheating the oven at 375ªF.

3. Braiding

    See [this video](https://youtu.be/cMM2LJz4-v8?si=-ofex9ZcY54wa4hR) for 3- and 4-strand braiding instructions!

4. Baking

    Beat the remaining egg and brush on the loaves. Sprinkle on the poppy or sesame seeds if desired.

    Bake for 32-35 minutes until nicely browned on top.
