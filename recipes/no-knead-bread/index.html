<ul>
<li>430g flour</li>
<li>1g yeast</li>
<li>16g salt</li>
<li>345g water</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<p>In a large bowl, combine ingredients and stir until blended and the dough is shaggy and sticky. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 12-18 hours.</p>
<p>The dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Sprinkle some flour on the dough and fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. Generously coat some parchment paper with flour, wheat bran or cornmeal; put dough seam side down and dust with more flour, bran or cornmeal. Cover with a cotton towel and let rise for about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.</p>
<p>At least half an hour before the dough is ready, heat the oven to 450 degrees. Put a 6- to 8-quart heavy dutch oven in the oven as it heats. When the dough is ready, <em>carefully</em> remove the pot from oven. Lower the dough on the parchment paper into the pot; it may look like a mess, but thatâ€™s okay. Shake the pot once or twice if the dough is unevenly distributed (it will straighten out as it bakes). Cover with the lid and bake for 30 minutes, then remove the lid and bake for another 15 to 30 minutes until the loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.</p>
