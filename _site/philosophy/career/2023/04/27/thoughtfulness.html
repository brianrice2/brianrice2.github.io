    <p>A lot of the gripes about working an office job, and just existing in society nowadays, can be attributed to thoughtlessness.</p>

<p>People looking to upskill are bombarded with an incredible amount of low-quality “10 Ways to Level Up as a Data Scientist” and “3 Essential Tips to Senior Engineer” content that has a lot of words (and ads) and yet you walk away without learning much of anything. It’s much easier to read (and generate) these articles than to sit down and spend a few hours critically examining your past, present, and future goals with respect to your experience, strengths, and weaknesses. There are a few good learning roadmaps out there for programming-adjacent jobs—just pick the one with the most stars on Github and get on your way. Anyways, they invariably end up rehashing the same fundamental categories anyways: learn about data structures and algorithms, databases, statistics or networking. Learn about how an interpreter works, or your operating system, or your computer hardware. This knowledge will serve you for the next several years, assuming you can anchor the ideas to something, while the 10 newest syntax features of Python 3.11 is wasted effort unless you’ve already put in hours of practice with Python. Syntax changes all the time, while the same few key data structures and algorithms show up ad infinitum.</p>

<p>Even in the most frustrating of cases, so many professionals cannot be bothered to read through an error’s stack trace before asking a coworker or Google for help—but how do they even know the right question to ask?</p>

<p>Taking the time to reflect upon things at a macro scale, or even a micro scale, is unfortunately less common than I would like. But doing minor things can help. Decline questionable meetings with or without a polite request to redirect to an asynchronous method. Add an agenda and desired outcome to all your meeting invites to prevent runaway meetings and hopefully inspire teammates to do the same. In your everyday life, avoid the urge to throw on a Youtube video or podcast in the background of other activities. Apps have been so finely overengineered to grab your attention that it can be quite difficult, but it’s essential to create some empty space for reflection.</p>

<p>Like my old cross country coach would say, slow is smooth, smooth is fast. Working thoughtfully is slow and smooth and fast. Struggling with a problem? Bother to understand what is going on and make a few reasonable attempts to resolve the issue—anyone whose help you ask for later will thank you.</p>
