    <p>Ahh, back in street sweeping season once again in Chicago, when car owners struggle to fit on one side of the road and then switch over to the other side immediately after sweeping. I always felt like the timing was random, but it looks like it’s actually a very <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/streets/provdrs/streets_san/svcs/street_sweeping2023.html">predictable once per month per section</a>. The <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/streets/iframe/sweeper_tracker.html">Sweeper Tracker</a> seems pretty cool, but unfortunately it looks like it’s down at the moment.</p>

<p>It also marks my one-year anniversary of selling my car! Public transit is quite solid in Chicago, so I haven’t regretted the decision since. Through walking, biking, public transit, and sometimes ride shares, I can get anywhere I need to go pretty easily. Sure, it sometimes takes a bit longer than driving, but with some planning it’s not much worse.</p>

<p>I saved a lot of money:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$1,000 in car insurance costs</li>
  <li>$1,310 in estimated wear and tear (based on $0.655/mile and 2,000 miles/year). This might be an overestimate – on one hand, I didn’t spend very much on maintenance when I did own (mostly just gas and oil changes), but on the other hand the car was a 2010 model so something big could’ve come up.</li>
  <li>$120 in parking costs (street parking is pretty cheap where I live – it can easily be twice as much <em>per month</em> closer to downtown!)</li>
  <li>$1XX in registration fees and taxes. Both Evanston and Chicago have a wheel tax, although <a href="https://www.civicfed.org/civic-federation/blog/cook-county-repeals-wheel-tax">this is going away as of June 30, 2023</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I spent some money too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$100 on OurBus tickets and train fare to travel home. Every time except for once (a few days after Christmas), the bus has been nearly empty with plenty of room to spread out.</li>
</ul>

<p>I feel better:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I walk 3/4-miles to the grocery once or twice a week (or I bike instead)</li>
  <li>If I have to travel a bit further, I take the bus or el or I bike instead</li>
  <li>I don’t have to worry about my car getting any parking tickets from the street sweepers :) this was the only ticket I’d ever received, and it was because my battery died and I couldn’t move the car in time</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all it comes out to a few thousand per year in saved money and hassle. But on the other hand, I do pay a little extra in time for certain trips (though it’s sometimes even faster to bike!). Well worth it!</p>
