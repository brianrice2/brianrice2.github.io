<p>Overall this makes a lot of sense to me. Personally though, drinking can be any of the 3 types. Sometimes it’s a lot of fun. Sometimes I’m tired or not feeling social and it’s a terrible time. And sometimes it doesn’t feel noteworthy at all but I find myself fondly looking back at it the next day/week/whatever. To my dismay, I haven’t figured out a good indicator of when each type happens though. It tends to be more fun if I have time to prepare—then I have it to look forward to; I can rest, take a nap, and have some coffee beforehand; and I can have a big meal beforehand. I guess most of those are energy-related—as a morning person, I definitely have trouble staying up as late as my friends (normalize going out at 7pm!).</p>

<p>Here Susan Wolf proposes that a successful life has 3 components: you’re <em>actively engaged</em> in a project of <em>positive value</em> with <em>moderate success</em>. Pitfalls are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lacking active engagement, living a life of passivity like The Blob</li>
<li>Lacking positive value, like the corporate worker who works endlessly simply to accumulate more personal wealth or the rich person who lives a busy lifestyle full of useless things</li>
<li>Lacking moderate success—that your contributions are fruitless and/or you cannot provide for yourself (what she calls bankruptcy)</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought it was really interesting how they get so specific about what their dream lives look like—not just how many kids they have or where they live, but if and how often a cleaner comes to their home or what kind of clothes they were and how often they buy new ones. I don’t have the faintest idea about what it’s actually like to live in New York City though.</p>
<p>Aliya’s story really showed how the wealthiest people can live paycheck to paycheck as people simply try to keep up with the absurdly high expectations for spending when your primary social circle is full of incredibly wealthy people. I thought it was cute that Chen wanted to have a multigenerational household, but I felt I lined up the best with Ian’s lifestyle.</p>

<p>I really liked the comment they quoted that “the internet is larger than any one metropolis, but browsing it today feels like walking down a narrow circular hallway.” The proliferation of massive recommendation systems continually show you more of what they <em>think</em> you like. I’ve never felt that even multi-armed bandits, which are supposed to balance exploration with exploitation, do a good enough job with continued variety—it always feels as though it finds a few niches that I like and loses the ability to move to new ones once I’ve lost interest in watching those same types of videos over and over again. They’re too short-sighted.</p>
