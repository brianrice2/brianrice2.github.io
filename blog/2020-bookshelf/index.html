    <main> <p>I’ve decided to make a specific post for the books I read each year. This is partly to better remember the books I read, but also to encourage me to read more (for fear of shame from strangers on the internet). Lately, they have been a welcome reprieve from social media and the constant barrage of despairing news stories.</p>
<p>The list will be updated over time as I start and finish new books. So, here is my list for 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean Code by Robert Martin</li>
<li>Build a Career in Data Science by Emily Robinson and Jacqueline Nolis (a great read!)</li>
<li>R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund</li>
<li>R Packages by Hadley Wickham</li>
<li>Deep Medicine by eric Topol
<ul>
<li>This one took a while to get through! I found myself constantly looking up terminology and companies to get a better picture of what Eric was describing. Regardless, it was really interesting to hear the perspective of medical practitioners and not just AI researchers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On Tyranny by Timothy Snyder</li>
<li>1984 by George Orwell</li>
<li>SQL Indexing and Tuning by Markus Winand</li>
<li>Fluent Python, 2nd ed. by Luciano Ramalho
<ul>
<li>An excellent read — I learned a ton!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[Unfinished] Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann</li>
<li>[Unfinished] The Best Short Stories of Dostoevsky, comprised of:
<ul>
<li>White Nights</li>
<li>The Honest Thief</li>
<li>The Christmas Tree and a Wedding</li>
<li>The Peasant Marey</li>
<li>Notes from the Underground</li>
<li>A Gentle Creature</li>
<li>The Dream of a Ridiculous Man</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
