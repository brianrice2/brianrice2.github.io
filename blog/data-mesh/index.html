    <main> <p>There’s a lot of talk around data meshes these days. It didn’t click for me until I read <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html">How to Move Beyond a Monolithic Data Lake to a Distributed Data Mesh</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A data mesh is like a microservice architecture for data.</strong></p>
<p>Applying a service-oriented architecture to applications and programs leads to microservices, which have been around in the software industry for some time now. Applying the same pattern to <em>data</em> leads to a data mesh.</p>
<p>Whether a team’s product is an application or data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain teams are responsible for maintaining their own product</li>
<li>They define an API for other teams to interact with their product</li>
<li>They define SLOs to make promises around the quality and characteristics of their product</li>
<li>Other products query/pull as <em>they</em> need, rather than pushing or publishing outward</li>
<li>Implementation details are left up to the product team. Just like an application may choose which libraries it wants to use to deliver its results, a data team can choose how and where to store its intermediate data or how to structure its data transformation pipelines.</li>
<li>Products are cataloged in some centrally available discovery tool so that the organization has a place for finding products</li>
<li>Care must be taken to ensure that global definitions of the same concept are in line (in other words, the same ideas are represented consistently across the organization)</li>
<li>Products are secure, etc.</li>
</ul>
