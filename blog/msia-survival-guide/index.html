    <main> <p>The MS in Analytics program, affectionately referred to as MSiA, is a full-time analytics (data science) program in the McCormick School of Engineering at Northwestern. It’s a fairly intense program, requiring significant time and financial commitments, but boasts solid industry experiences and good career outcomes for graduates. The curriculum focuses primarily on breadth, especially considering the quarter system, and leaves the depth-building experiences to practicum/capstone/extracurricular projects and outside research/practice.</p>

<li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Industry Capstone</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-i-wish-i-knew">What I Wish I Knew</h2>
<ol>
<li>Learn environment and package management, whether it’s conda, pipenv, virtualenv, or something else</li>
<li>Learn to use LaTeX</li>
<li>Be aggressive with your time management. There is always lots to do, whether school, career, or personal.</li>
<li>Pay attention to the late policies :-)</li>
<li>Focus on one thing at a time</li>
<li>The easiest way to stay up-to-date on class materials is to go to class and pay attention (you’d be surprised how rare this is) (focus on one thing at a time)</li>
<li>Read the optional readings if you’re interested in an area. There’s not much time in the quarter system to get into the super nitty gritty of an area. But hey, do what you want.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="industry-extracurricular-projects">Industry &amp; Extracurricular Projects</h2>
<p>In general, the amount of workload you have depends a great deal on the project you end up on. In general, the better scoped your project is, the more manageable it will be (if only because your point of contact won’t have super unrealistic expectations of what can be accomplished in the time frame and the skills that you have or don’t have)</p>
<h3 id="400-everything-starts-with-data-project">400: Everything Starts with Data Project</h3>
<p>Unlike other class projects in the program, this course’s projects deal with external clients. It’s still a short time frame, so try to be realistic with what you think can be completed.</p>
<h3 id="practicum">Practicum</h3>
<p>When ranking your practicum selections, pay attention not only to the</p>
<h3 id="capstone">Capstone</h3>
<p>Since these are so much shorter than practicum, the proposal should reflect the shortened time span.</p>
<h3 id="extracurricular-projects">Extracurricular projects</h3>
<p>These can be a really great way to work on an interesting project and develop some expertise in areas not normally covered in the program curriculum. I took up a project with the Center for Deep Learning and got work with some really cool technologies. Because of the nature of these projects, they can vary quite a bit. But if you can manage your time well enough to work on one, it can give you some really interesting experience and some valuable skills.</p>
<h2 id="career-resources">Career Resources</h2>
<h3 id="networking-nights">Networking nights</h3>
<p>Brazen can be tough. Enter the queue for multiple different companies at the same time to reduce the wait.</p>
<h3 id="working-during-the-program">Working during the program</h3>
<p>Some people choose to work in addition to their academic responsibilities, although the program’s official stance is to recommend against it. If you do want to, the sweet spot is somewhere around 10 hours per week (not much). You will still have to manage your time well, but it brings in some money without too much impact on school. Getting up to 20 hours per week will be a significant challenge, and working full-time is near-impossible, although I did this during the final quarter. The extra experience is just not worth it, even if it doesn’t impact your grades. Overall, I’d recommend against it as this is (probably) the last period in your life when you can focus wholeheartedly on school. If you have too much free time, learn how to appreciate it and spend the time on yourself and your friends.</p>
<h2 id="personal-pro-tips">(Personal) Pro tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>iPads are great for taking notes in class. Apps like <a href="https://www.goodnotes.com/">GoodNotes</a> make editing, organizing, searching, and exporting notes a breeze.</li>
<li>Create meeting documents beforehand to plan out discussions and record old &amp; new business.</li>
<li>You have a free subscription to read books on O’Reilly’s website. Use it! There are some great technical books to learn from.
<ul>
<li>Same for software: Free JetBrains license, GitHub student pack, and more</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Write your resume in LaTeX (e.g., using Overleaf). For starters, you have a great deal of control over the structure and appearance of the document. But you can also comment out bullet points to customize your application per company without losing access to that information. Essentially, it makes it super easy to tailor your resume to whichever job you’re applying to. You don’t need to keep some master/reference document with a bunch of accomplishments—these become out of date quickly anyways.</li>
<li>Interviewing is a particular skill, separate from skills covered in courses and jobs, that pays dividends to  develop. Like it or not, investing time to <a href="https://fs.blog/deliberate-practice-guide/">deliberately practice</a> this skill can dramatically influence your ability to get offers and your quality of life post-graduation. The state of interviewing may be less than ideal, but it benefits you to play the game well.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="worth-it">Worth It?</h2>
<p>For sure. The cost is prohibitive for some, but (1) the topics are very interesting, (2) the cohort approach is a great structure to get to know each other, (3) the career prospects are good, and (4) the industry projects (practicum and capstone) are a net positive experience.</p>
