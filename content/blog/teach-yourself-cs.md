Tracking my journey through [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com)

&nbsp;

## Programming

- [x] Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
- [x] Brian Harvey’s Berkeley CS 61A

This was a good introduction to how programming languages are built and how interpreters work. I didn't do any of the exercises, even though maybe I should have. The lectures provided a nice higher-level explanation of the material in the book, but I still found value in both. Lisp/Scheme seems cool, but I probably won't pick it up any time soon.

Finished chapters 1-3 (4-5 didn't seem as relevant/valuable). Started _Composing Programs_.
