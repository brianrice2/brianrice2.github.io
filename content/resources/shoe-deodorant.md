title: Deodorize Your Climbing Shoes

Boot Bananas are great (I hear), but they're also expensive. Worse, they're wasteful yet marketed towards a sport that values the natural world.

The ingredients are easy to understand. Sodium bicarbone (baking soda) and bamboo charcoal help to absorb and remove bad odors, and the rest (dried lavender flowers, zeolite, essential oils of lavender, lemon, patchouli, tea tree) help to mask with a pleasant odor.

The minimal, cheaper, and faster solution? Baking soda.

- Mix baking soda and water in a bowl until it's the consistency of a paste or goop
- Use a toothbrush to coat the entire inside surface (upper and lower)
- Let dry for several hours until the goop is flaky and the shoes smell better
- Rinse with cool water
- Air dry (stuffing with newspaper helps here)

Boom, shoes that smell as good as new. Well, not quite that new shoe smell, but still nothing to be self-conscious about.
