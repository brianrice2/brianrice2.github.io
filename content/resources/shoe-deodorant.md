Even better than Boot Bananas.

- Mix baking soda and water in a bowl until it's the consistency of a paste or goop
- Use a toothbrush to coat the entire inside surface (upper and lower)
- Let dry for several hours until the goop is flaky and the shoes smell better
- Rinse with cool water
- Air dry (stuffing with newspaper helps here)

Boom, shoes that smell as good as new. Well, not quite that new shoe smell, but still nothing to be self-conscious about.
