## Construction

Unless otherwise specified, all seam allowances are 1/2" and basting is done at 1/4".

### 1. Handles

Mark the side panels at what will be the bottom edge at the centerpoint ± 3.5" (i.e. at the 5" and 12" mark). Baste the ends of the webbing handle here, making sure that the webbing isn't twisted.

For PALS-style handles, add bartacks every 1.5" along the side panels. If not, then stitch a few millimeters from the edges and finish with a box stitch just over 1/2" from the top for extra durability.

### 2. Shoulder strap

At the centerpoint of the top panel, sew on the small webbing pieces with a D-ring inside, using a box stitch for extra strength.

### 3. Zipper

Cut the top panel in a straight line at any angle - centered is classic, but I find that a diagonal slice adds some more visual interest. If using a liner, do the same with the top panel piece.

![Zipper step 1](zipper-1.svg)

Starting on one side, sew the zipper to the outer body fabric, right sides facing (remember that if you're using a waterproof zipper, the *shiny/coated* side is the right side). You want to shoot for a seam that's centered between the teeth of the zipper and the edge of the zipper tape, so that the final panel remains the same size as before. This can take a few tried - don't be afraid to seam rip and try again.

Flip the fabric around and topstitch a few millimeters from the previous seam.

Repeat for the other side. It should look something like this now and be very close to the size of the original panel:

Separate the zipper and slide in the zipper pull, making sure to keep the panels well aligned.

### 4. Outer pockets

Fold the pocket panels over twice at 1/2" each time. Topstitch a few mm from the fold.

Baste onto the smaller side panels, going back and forth a few times at the top of the pocket for extra durability.

### 5. Hanging inner pocket



### 6. Join the panels

For this section, start and stop the seams 1/2" (one seam allowance) away from the edge of the fabric - this is the trick for easier box corners. This can take some practice to get right!

If you're using a liner, sew all the panels together (right sides facing) EXCEPT for the top panel to form an open basin. Do the same with the outer body fabric, then attach the two together (wrong sides facing) along the top perimeter.

Finally, we'll add the top panel.

## Variations

- This pattern is easy to resize - just follow the 2:1:1 ratio to keep things proportional
- You might also like to use a bullet mesh for the side pockets with flat elastic for the top lip

Enjoy your new bag!
