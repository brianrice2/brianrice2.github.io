So many cans.

## Ingredients

- 3 Tbsp curry powder
- 2 tsp cumin
- 2 tsp garam masala (optional)
- 2 yellow onions
- 4 garlic cloves
- 1/2 tsp ground ginger
- 4 cans chickpeas, drained
- 16 oz tomato sauce
- 27 oz coconut milk
- 8 oz / 3 cups chopped kale

## Preparation

Saute the onions for five minutes or so until soft and translucent. While that happens, prepare the spices and garlic and ready the canned goods.

Add the garlic and, once it's fragrant, add the spices and toast for a minute.

Add the drained chickpeas, tomato sauce, and coconut milk and stir to combine. Bring to a boil and then simmer for about 15 minutes.

Finally, add the kale and cook until wilted nicely, 5 minutes or so. Salt to taste, about 1 tsp.
