## Ingredients

For the dough:

- 512g flour
- 455g water
- 8g instant yeast
- 12g salt
- 20-30g olive oil

## Preparation

1. Bulk fermentation

Whisk together the dry ingredients. Add the water and mix until no dry flour remains. Add the olive oil and work until it's nice and saturated. Cover with a lid or plastic wrap and pop into the fridge for 12-72 hours.

&nbsp;

2. Second rise

Drizzle olive oil into a 9x13 baking pan until the bottom is covered (a tablespoon or so). Deflate the dough and turn it onto the pan. Cover with greased plastic wrap and let rest for 2-4 hours.

At the end of proofing, the dough should be well risen and puffy with gas bubbles. Preheat the oven to 450ºF ([or 425ºF if baking in glass](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2018/03/29/glass-or-metal-or-stoneware#:~:text=The%20standard%20advice%20for%20baking,up%20to%2010%20minutes%20longer.)).

3. Baking

Gently dimple the proofed dough with wet fingers. Drizzle olive oil over the dough. Sprinkle flaky salt and fresh herbs over the top. If using other toppings like grape tomatoes or olives, add them now too and gently press into the dough.

Place on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes until golden on top. Let rest under a cloth on a wire rack for 5 minutes before slicing.
