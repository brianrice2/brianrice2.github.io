title: Korean Lentils
---

## Ingredients

- 1.5 cups (1/2 lb) dry green/brown lentils, inspected and rinsed
- 5 cups water
- 16 oz sliced mushrooms
- 2 Tbsp toasted sesame oil

For serving:

- 2.25 cups brown Basmati rice
- 2.25 cups water
- Frozen broccoli

For the sauce:

- 2 Tbsp toasted sesame oil
- 4 cloves garlic, minced, or 1 tsp garlic powder
- 2 Tbsp fresh ginger, minced or microplaned, or 1/2 tsp ginger powder
- 1/4 cup brown sugar, packed
- 1/4 cup (4 Tbsp) soy sauce
- 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
- Ground black pepper

## Preparation

First, set 5 cups of water in a Dutch oven over high heat. When it reaches boiling, add the lentils and lower the heat to medium-low (ish) so they simmer gently for 20-25 minutes.

While the lentils cook, start the rice. If you're using a pressure cooker, rinse the rice and add an equal amount of cold, clean water. Set to cook for 15 minutes.

Next, prepare the sauce. Whisk together the ingredients in a small bowl and save for later. Rinse and dry the sliced mushrooms so they can sear.

When the lentils are done, drain them. Add sesame oil to the pot and sear the mushrooms over medium-high heat, in batches if needed. While they cook, prepare your broccoli.

Add the sauce and cooked lentils to the mushrooms, stirring up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan, and lower the heat to medium-low. Simmer until the sauce is reduced to your liking.
