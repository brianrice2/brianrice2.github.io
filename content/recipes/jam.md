As simple as it gets.

Total time: ~30 minutes

## Ingredients

- 1 pound fruit, chopped
- 1/2 to 2/3 cup (100-130 g) granulated sugar
- 3 Tbsp lemon juice

## Preparation

Place a plate in the freezer for testing the doneness later.

Combine the ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat and mash with a fork or potato masher.

Stirring frequently, reduce until thickened, about 15-20 minutes.

To check for doneness, drop a small amount of jam onto a small frozen plate. Let cool for a moment, then run a spoon or finger through the jam. If you can draw a line with clean edges that don’t drip, then it's ready. If it runs back together, then cook for a few more minutes and try again.
