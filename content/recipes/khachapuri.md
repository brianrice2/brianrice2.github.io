Total time: ~3.5 hours

## Ingredients

For the dough:

- 200g flour, plus more for kneading
- 2g instant dry yeast
- 2g sugar
- 2g kosher salt
- 125 ml warm water
- 2g olive oil

For the filling:

- 150g low-moisture mozzarella
- 75g crumbled feta
- 1 egg, lightly beaten

For serving:

- 1 Tbsp melted unsalted butter
- 1 Tbsp (cold) unsalted butter
- 1 egg

## Preparation

1. Dough

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and stir until it forms a sticky dough.

Turn it out onto a work surface and knead until the dough is smooth, about 3 minutes, adding just a sprinkle of flour if sticking. Shape the dough into a ball.

Coat a clean bowl with the olive oil, add the dough, and turn to coat. Cover and let rest for ~1.5 hours until doubled in size.

Punch down the dough, reshape it into a ball, cover, and let rise again for another hour.

Preheat the oven to 450ºF near the end of the second rise.

2. Shaping and Filling

Shape the dough into a ~12" round. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.

While it rests, combine the filling ingredients and mix with a fork.

Roll the edge of the dough towards the center and twist the ends to seal them. Transfer to a baking sheet and fix the shape as needed. Add the cheese filling.

4. Baking

Bake for 15 minutes. It should look slightly underdone but the filling should be bubbling and have some nice brown spots.

Remove from the oven and, working quickly, use the rounded side of a spoon to make a well in the filling. Add the whole egg into the indentation and return to the oven for about 3-5 minutes, just until the egg white is barely set. The yolk should still be runny.

Remove from the oven. Brush the rim with the melted butter and put the slice of butter on the filling next to the egg. Let the butter soften slightly, then stir the filling with a fork until it is creamy and the egg is cooked.

Sprinkle with mint and chile and serve immediately.
