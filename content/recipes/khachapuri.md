title: Khachapuri

Total time:

## Ingredients:

For the dough:

- 200g flour, plus more for kneading
- 2g instant dry yeast
- 2g sugar
- 2g kosher salt
- 125 ml warm water
- 2g olive oil

For the filling:

- 150g low-moisture mozzarella
- 100g crumbled feta
- 1 egg, lightly beaten
- 1 more egg
- 3g flour
- 1 Tbsp melted unsalted butter
- 1 Tbsp (cold) unsalted butter

## Preparation

1. Dough

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and stir until it forms a sticky dough.

Turn it out onto a work surface and knead until the dough is smooth, about 3 minutes, adding just a sprinkle of flour if sticking. Shape the dough into a ball.

Coat a clean bowl with the olive oil, add the dough, and turn to coat. Cover and let rest for ~1.5 hours until doubled in size.

Punch down the dough, reshape it into a ball, cover, and let rise again for another hour.

2. Filling

Put the four cheeses in a bowl and toss with a fork to blend. Add the beaten egg and flour and mix well. Crack the remaining egg into a bowl but leave it whole.

Put a baking stone on a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 450ºF at least 45 minutes before baking.

3. Shaping

Stretch the dough on a lightly floured surface with your hands or a rolling pin into an oval about 14 inches long and 10 inches wide at the widest part. Beginning on one of the long sides, roll the edge of the dough toward the center to form a rope-like rim about ¾ inch wide. Repeat on the other long side. Twist the ends to seal them. Your “boat” of dough should be 13 to 14 inches long and 9 to 10 inches wide before filling, so stretch it with your hands as needed. Transfer the boat to a sheet of parchment, then slide the parchment onto a rimless baking sheet or pizza peel. Stretch the dough again if needed to preserve the shape.

Put the cheese filling in the center and spread it to an even thickness.

4. Baking

Slide the boat (still on the parchment) onto the baking stone and bake 15 minutes. It should look slightly underdone but the filling should be bubbling and have some nice brown spots. Using the rimless baking sheet or peel, remove the khachapuri from the oven and, working quickly, use the rounded side of a spoon to make a well in the filling large enough for the egg yolk. Slide the egg into the indentation and return to the oven for about 3 minutes—just until the egg white is barely set. The yolk should still be runny.

Remove from the oven. Brush the rim with the melted butter and put the slice of butter on the filling next to the egg. Let the butter soften slightly, then stir the filling with a fork until it is creamy and the egg is cooked. Sprinkle with mint and chile and serve immediately.
